# Java-based Python Script Executor
This application executes a Python script which reads from a selected .txt or .tsv file and writes to a Microsoft Excel file. To use, run the .jar file, click File->Open, navigate to your Python(3.7+) installation (ex. "C:\Python\..."), locate the Python executable file (.exe or .app), from File->Open select navigate to the file you wish to read from, then choose the name of the output file and click Save As. 

This application requires the Python xlwt library (https://pypi.org/project/xlwt/).
